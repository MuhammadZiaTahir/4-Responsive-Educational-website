          Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
          and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly
          assists in curriculum development, accreditation and in the financing
          of research and development. Article 25-A of Constitution of Pakistan
          obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education
          to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide
          free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to
          sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law". The
          education system in Pakistan is generally divided into six levels:
          preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (years one to
          five), middle (years six to eight), high (years nine and ten, leading
          to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (years
          eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or
          HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate
          degrees. The Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is
          responsible for all universities and degree awarding institutes.[6] It
          was established in 2002 with Atta-ur-Rahman as its Founding Chairman

          Education plays a crucial role in developing countries by transmitting
          necessary life skills to the future citizens. After the eighteenth
          amendment was abolished in 2010, there was more autonomy available to
          people in the health care and education spectrums. Technical and
          Vocational Education Training (TVET) raised attention because
          education helps prepare students for future employment. TVET classes
          also offer money management lessons, personal and family health
          practices, and healthcare information. Providing proper TVET site
          management, adequate teacher salaries, competent teachers, up-to-date
          curriculum, and equity in the programs are challenges faced by
          Pakistani leaders. The major goals of TVET include investing in the
          country's workforce to stimulate the economy and redistribute the
          wealth.

          After the approval of the World Health Organization and the Ministry
          of Education of China, SICAS institutions have exemplified and
          classified Chinese universities where Pakistani students recognized by
          pmdc come to study in China through online methods As of January 2015,
          the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Pakistan as having
          439 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in
          the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the
          school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary
          or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an
          English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is
          one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum
          other than the country's national curriculum and is international in
          its orientation." This definition is used by publications including
